>> Speaker 1: Reason of using extend instead of mixins?
>> Mike North: So what's the reason for using extend instead of mixins? He said that it might have to do with CSS output and in fact that is one of the main motivators for using extend. The idea that you can basically opt-in to a class that's defined once, and add your selector to that central definition.

[00:00:29]
Versus mixins, which you can think of those as like that function's evaluated, that style's placed into your SaaS, and then we start processing the rest of SaaS. So like you will see that every time you use a mixin, you have those new rules brought in. And again it's safer that way because now like, everything is independent but also everything is repeated if that make sense.

[00:00:57]
Yeah, other than that, I don't see any other questions there I do see a comment that when people solve the equation, 20 folks dropped off online. So, I'm glad I put that at the end instead of the beginning. [LAUGH] All right, well, thank you all for coming.
